December the 31st, the last day of the year and more importantly the last day of my vacations from work. I'll be deviating from my "technical" norms to a generalized post this particular time.

This year had some highs and a lot of lows. I'm adding some of the points that I believe I need to pay attention to this particular year.

**Take life seriously:**

Now is the time to consider whether I need to go ahead with further studies or not and to evaluate whether my current career path will take me anywhere down the line. Furthermore, Pakistan is plummeting into a downward spiral



	
  * Electricity load-shedding.

	
  * Gas load-shedding  We've reached a point where we need to ration gas for either cooking a meal or boiling a cup of water for tea.

	
  * Any chances of Pakistan leaning towards a more secular stance has gone down the drain.

	
  * Bigotry in this country has no bounds. Examples include the inability to listen to music at work on speakers, the inability to watch youtube(banned), and at one point even google maps was banned( perhaps our government thought mother nature was committing blasphemy)


**Maintain a healthy lifestyle:**

I started following the slow carb diet life style around a month and a half back. Initially it was quite hard, but now I'm getting into the groove of it. Recently my brother has been pushing me into hitting the gym. Need to be regular with that as well.



	
  * Exercising atleast 3 times, 30 minutes a week

	
  * Flipping my table at work so that my eyes can focus on distant objects. Found an app called xwrits that enforces breaks after a certain period of time.

	
  * Avoiding Diet Coke(You shall be missed)

	
  * Continue with bringing my own lunches to work(note: plural)


**Be more selfish:**

I have this horrid habit of never saying no whenever someone asks for a favor. This ultimately results in stalling and doing the task half-heartedly. I need to learn how to effectively use the phrase "bugger off" or perhaps learn the art of the [hitch slap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL1A1fCRaaA).

**Be More Professional with work:**

My biggest regret of this year is how I let my work desecrate the rest of my life. It devastated my eating habits as a result of which I gained a lot of weight. Also, the extremely long hours laid waste some hobbies of mine that I once considered sacred, namely reading, ridiculously long walks whilst listening to music and learning bizarre tricks( so far I can do traditional juggling, know various pen and card tricks and finally, the thing I'm most proud of, juggle with 2 pieces of food by alternately spitting them in the air; gross + choking hazard = double win)



	
  * Fixed 9:30 - 6:30 timings +- 15 minutes.

	
  * Increase my productivity.

	
  * Invest an hour or two of my office timings towards honing my craft. Hopefully this should curb the feelings of regret that I recently have been feeling at work primarily due to the monotonous nature of work. Currently I've being doing this right after my 10-12 hours shift of work.
