[![](http://sohaibbbhatti.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/bhtmux.jpg?w=250)](http://sohaibbbhatti.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/bhtmux.jpg)After having shifted to Vim as my default editor for over 6 months, I decided it was time to take a leap of faith and get my hands dirty with tmux. In order to aide me in my quest, I opted for "The Pragmatic Programmers" series book by Brian P. Hogan.

Honestly, At a first glance(mainly by looking at the number of pages) I thought that the book would be a dodgy read, probably because I thought tmux would be something really cryptic. Boy was I wrong!

I'm quite sure that the core concepts of tmux can easily be acquired from some other free reading resources, however, the custom configuration file that the author builds in parallel with explaining key-concepts alone is worth the books money. All the key-bindings are mapped to "vim-friendly" keys which makes using tmux a breeze! After a mere 2 hours of reading the book, I was whizzing around, coding away without facing any major difficulties with tmux. Sure I had to look at a couple of shortcuts along the way, but hey, that is to be expected.

I'd highly recommend people interested in tmux to give this book a try. Going through it Â shouldn't take more than a mere relaxed evening read.

I'll most probably be trying the pragmatic series coffescript or Sass book next
