Since the day I learned HAML, I developed this really badÂ habit. Whenever I've to add a div with a single class I would use the proper notation.

    
    .brandImageLogo


However, as soon as multiple classes arise, I'd use an awkward notation.

    
    div{class: 'brandImageLogo floatLeft center'}


However I trudged upon the 'proper way' of how to do this.

    
    .brandImageLogo.floatLeft.center


Just proves how important it is to keep reading up on things you believe you're comfortable with!
